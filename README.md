 **Database Backup and Recovery**

This repository contains scripts and documentation for backing up and restoring a MySQL database. The goal is to ensure that in the event of a database failure, the data can be recovered without loss.

---

 **Contents**

- `backup.sh` – Script for backing up a MySQL database  
- `restore.sh` – Script for restoring a MySQL database  
- `DOCUMENTATION.md` – Detailed documentation of the backup and recovery process

---

 **Backup Script**

The `backup.sh` script creates a backup of a MySQL database and saves it as a `.sql` file with a timestamp.

 **Usage**

1. Open the `backup.sh` file and update the following variables:
   ```bash
   DB_NAME="your_database"
   USER="root"
   PASSWORD="your_password"
   BACKUP_DIR="/path/to/backup"
   ```
2. Run the script using:
   ```bash
   ./backup.sh
   ```
3. A backup file will be created in the specified directory with a timestamp.

---

 **Restore Script**

The `restore.sh` script restores a MySQL database from a backup file.

 **Usage**

1. Open the `restore.sh` file and update the following variables:

   DB_NAME="your_database"
   USER="root"
   PASSWORD="your_password"
   BACKUP_FILE="/path/to/backup/your_database-backup.sql"
  
2. Run the script using:
   
   ./restore.sh
 
3. The script will restore the database from the specified backup file.

---

 **Steps to Verify the Process**

1. After running the `restore.sh` script, use MySQL queries to check if the data is restored correctly.
2. Ensure that all key tables and data are present after restoration.

---

 **Requirements**

- MySQL installed on the system  
- Bash shell (Linux/Mac) or Git Bash (Windows)  
- Sufficient permissions to access and modify the database



 **Summary**

This project demonstrates a complete backup and recovery process for a MySQL database using bash scripts. The provided scripts are reusable and can be customized for different databases and environments.
